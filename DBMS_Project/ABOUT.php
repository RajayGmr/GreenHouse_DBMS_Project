            Our store has been recogized by various continent as it is pure based in Thailand and we hire our Gardeners
        and other employees who are much qualified ones and Is considered educated in the society.<br><br>

        OUR ORIGIN:<br><br>
        A gardener without a greenhouse is a bit like a cook without a stove.
         Yes you can manage, improvise and still be creative, but the greenhouse facilitates much more than you might imagine.
          A greenhouse allows you to concoct the most divine combinations for your garden, to experiment with your ingredients and nurture the most wonderful plants. 
          It supports your plants in a nurturing, caring environment and provides just the right conditions for plant growth.

        The relationship between a gardener and their greenhouse is emotional; of that there is no doubt. But there’s solid science behind the benefits of the greenhouse. And it’s not all about your plants.
         A greenhouse is a haven for the gardener, a place to practice horticultural alchemy and provides space for mindfulness activities as well as lifting the spirits on those wet, cold, dull days we so often experience. 
         It’s a shelter from the weather,
         a place for quiet reflection and somewhere away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.<br>
        
        <br> OUR MISSION:<br><br>
         Our mission is to inspire our community to go green and keeo reminding everyone how beautiful our nature is
          and in that way we will be able to educate children and also the grown up ones<br><br>
